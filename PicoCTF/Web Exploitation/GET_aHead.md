## Solution

```
The name of the challenge is GET aHEAD. This is a hint that we need to get the HEAD of the HTTP request.
One could use Wireshark or Burp Suite to intercept the request and get the flag.
However, the easiest way to get the flag is to use curl. The command I used is:
    curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/
Reasoning: The -I flag is used to get the HEAD of the HTTP request.
